Git HEAD
========

* empty


v1.22 (2011-04-10)
==================

* Windows: run-time dynamic linking to FFTW, releases include FFTW DLL

* Windows: stand-alone application (ASIO, DirectX)

* manual with full documentation

* another complete re-validation of K-Meter

* validation is now possible directly from within K-Meter

* wave files and instructions for validation of peak meter, overflow
  counter, phase correlation meter and stereo meter; corresponding
  fixes

* experimental support for surround sound

* changed overflow detection

* notify host of plug-in latency

* silenced output for unsupported sample rates

* fixed a few memory leaks and some minor bugs

* streamlined code and started commenting the code

* beautified meters


v1.21 (2010-12-12)
==================

* wave files and instructions for validation of K-Meter

* complete re-validation of K-Meter and corresponding fixes

* moved from premake v4.2 to v4.3

* generation of Visual C++ project files using premake4



v1.20 (2010-09-14)
==================

* automation and re/storing of plug-in parameters

* corrected overflow counting

* optimised displayed region of expanded meters



v1.19 (2010-09-06)
==================

* validated output

* fixed output buffer wrap-around

* merged both hold buttons into one

* some optical changes



v1.18 (2010-08-01)
==================

* band limiter for calculation of average RMS levels: windowed-sinc,
  high-pass @21 kHz (FFT convolution)

* process input buffers of arbitrary length using audio ring buffers

* pre-delay samples

* several optimisations

* first few manual pages



v1.17 (2010-07-17)
==================

* added button to hide peak meter (suggested by Bob Katz)

* added display showing maximum peak level



v1.16 (2010-06-28)
==================

* added "about" dialog

* average and peak meters now display the same value for sine waves

* calculate highest average levels after applying ballistics



v1.15 (2010-06-25)
==================

* added button to check mono compatibility

* optimised processor usage for mono instances



v1.14 (2010-06-21)
==================

* added correlation meter

* corrected and optimised algorithms for stereo meter



v1.13 (2010-06-20)
==================

* added graphical stereo meter

* moved configuration file of standalone to ".config/kmeter/kmeterrc"



v1.12 (2010-06-15, initial commit)
==================================

* K-20/RMS, K-14/RMS and K-12/RMS meters (plus normal meter for
  channel strips)

* meter ballistics, normal and 10x expanded scale, buttons for
  infinite peak and average hold, overflow counter, reset button

* GNU/Linux: VST plug-in, stand-alone (ALSA, Jack) Windows: VST
  plug-in

* still missing: band-limitation of average meter, validation of
  read-out
