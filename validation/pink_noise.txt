FLAC-compressed wave file (48 kHz, 24 bit)
==========================================
Please verify the correctness of K-System meter values over time by
making use of your eyes and the expanded metering mode.

00:00 - 00:03  silence
00:03 - 01:03  uncorrelated band-limited pink noise (20 Hz to 20000 Hz,
               -23.01 dB RMS)
01:03 - 01:06  silence


RMS correction of K-System meter
================================
RMS = A / sqrt(2)
RMS / A  = sqrt(2) = +3.01 dB


Pink noise (20 Hz to 20000 Hz, -23.01 dB RMS)
=============================================
K-20 :=   0.00 dB  (crest factor: 20 dB)
K-14 :=  -6.00 dB  (crest factor: 14 dB)
K-12 :=  -8.00 dB  (crest factor: 12 dB)
Norm := -20.00 dB  (crest factor:  0 dB)
