FLAC-compressed wave file (96 kHz, 24 bit)
==========================================
Please verify correctness of K-System meter values programmatically
while making sure that peak and average readouts match for sine waves.

Please notice that K-System meter readings may deviate from the true
value at very low frequencies (fluctuations due to meter ballistics
and audio chunk size) and very high frequencies (aliasing in the wave
file).

00:00 - 00:03  silence
00:03 - 01:03  sine sweep (10 Hz to 48 kHz, -4.00 dBFS, logarithmic)

00:57          check filter cutoff @21 kHz

01:03 - 01:06  silence
01:06 - 01:26  sine sweep (20 kHz to 24 kHz, -4.00 dBFS, linear)

01:11          check filter cutoff @21 kHz

01:26 - 01:29  silence
01:29 - 01:49  triangular sweep (20 Hz to 20 kHz, -4.00 dBFS, logarithmic)
01:49 - 01:52  silence
01:52 - 02:12  square sweep (20 Hz to 20 kHz, -4.00 dBFS, logarithmic)
02:12 - 02:15  silence


RMS correction of K-System meter (sine wave, -4.00 dBFS)
========================================================
RMS = A / sqrt(2)
RMS / A  = sqrt(2) = +3.01 dB
+3.01 dB + (-4.00 dB) = -0.99 dB

K-20 = 20.00 dB + (-0.99 dB) = 19.01 dB
K-14 = 14.00 dB + (-0.99 dB) = 13.01 dB
K-12 = 12.00 dB + (-0.99 dB) = 11.01 dB
Norm =  0.00 dB + (-0.99 dB) = -0.99 dB


Sine wave (-4.00 dBFS)
========================
RMS = A / sqrt(2)
A / RMS = 1/sqrt(2) = -3.01 dB

K-20 = 19.01 dB + (-3.01 dB) = 16.00 dB
K-14 = 13.01 dB + (-3.01 dB) = 10.00 dB
K-12 = 11.01 dB + (-3.01 dB) =  8.00 dB
Norm = -0.99 dB + (-3.01 dB) = -4.00 dB


Triangular or sawtooth wave (-4.00 dBFS)
==========================================
RMS = A / sqrt(3)
A / RMS = 1/sqrt(3) = -4.77 dB

K-20 = 19.01 dB + (-4.77 dB) = 14.24 dB
K-14 = 13.01 dB + (-4.77 dB) =  8.24 dB
K-12 = 11.01 dB + (-4.77 dB) =  6.24 dB
Norm = -0.99 dB + (-4.77 dB) = -5.76 dB


Square wave (-4.00 dBFS)
==========================
RMS = A
A / RMS = 1 = 0.00 dB

K-20 = 19.01 dB + ( 0.00 dB) = 19.01 dB
K-14 = 13.01 dB + ( 0.00 dB) = 13.01 dB
K-12 = 11.01 dB + ( 0.00 dB) = 11.01 dB
Norm = -0.99 dB + ( 0.00 dB) = -0.99 dB
