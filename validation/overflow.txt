FLAC-compressed wave file (44.1 kHz, 16 bit)
============================================
Please verify readout of overflow counter by making use of your eyes
and ears.

Given values describe the left channel.  The right channel is delayed
by one second and contains a sine wave with a frequency of 500 Hz.

00:00.000 - 00:02.000  silence

00:02.000 - 00:05.000  sine wave (150 Hz, -5.5 dBFS)

                       [both channels:  first audible click must not register]
                       [both channels:  second audible click must register]

                       [left  channel:  a total of 16 clips must register]
                       [right channel:  a total of  9 clips must register]

00:05.000 - 00:07.000  silence
