Validation settings
===================
File:     phase_correlation_meter.flac
Host SR:  44 100 Hz

          [ ] Average meter level
          [ ] Stereo meter value

Linear phase sweep
==================
left channel:   (441.0 periods / second) * 20 seconds = 8820 periods
right channel:  (441.1 periods / second) * 20 seconds = 8822 periods
                                                        ------------
difference:                                                2 periods

--> phase correlation oscillates *twice* between +1 and -1 (but keep
    in mind that meter ballistics interfere with the sweep and thus
    lead to a range of approximately +0.98 to -0.98)

--> please keep in mind that while the phase sweep is linear, the
    corresponding phase correlation is *not* linear (see below)!


Static phase shift
==================
Phase correlation has been calculated using the cross-correlation
function "ccf" in R (see "phase_correlation_meter.R" in this folder).

period length = (44100 samples / second) / 441 Hz = 100 samples

  0 samples delay / 100 samples =  0 % phase offset
--> phase correlation: +1.00

 10 samples delay / 100 samples = 10 % phase offset
--> phase correlation: +0.79

 20 samples delay / 100 samples = 20 % phase offset
--> phase correlation: +0.30

 30 samples delay / 100 samples = 30 % phase offset
--> phase correlation: -0.30

 40 samples delay / 100 samples = 40 % phase offset
--> phase correlation: -0.79

 50 samples delay / 100 samples = 50 % phase offset
--> phase correlation: -1.00
