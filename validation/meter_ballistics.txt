FLAC-compressed wave file (44.1 kHz, 16 bit)
============================================
Please verify correctness of meter ballistics programmatically.

00:00.000 - 00:02.000  silence
00:02.000 - 00:12.000  sine wave (2 kHz, 0 dBFS)
00:12.000 - 00:12.600  silence

00:12.600              [check fall time of average meters]

Metering minima
===============
-(20.00 dB + 70.00 dB) = -90.00 dB
(see constructor of class "MeterBallistics")


Fall time of average meters (0 dBFS sine)
=========================================
99% of final reading in 600 ms integration time

K-20 = 20.00 dB - 90.00 dB * 99% = -69.10 dB
K-14 = 14.00 dB - 90.00 dB * 99% = -75.10 dB
K-12 = 12.00 dB - 90.00 dB * 99% = -77.10 dB
Norm =  0.00 dB - 90.00 dB * 99% = -89.10 dB


Rise time of average meters (0 dBFS sine)
=========================================
99% of final reading in 600 ms integration time

K-20 = 20.00 dB - 90.00 dB *  1% =  19.10 dB
K-14 = 14.00 dB - 90.00 dB *  1% =  13.10 dB
K-12 = 12.00 dB - 90.00 dB *  1% =  11.10 dB
Norm =  0.00 dB - 90.00 dB *  1% =  -0.90 dB


Fall time of peak meters (0 dBFS sine)
======================================
-26 dB in 3 seconds

K-20 = 20.00 dB - 26.00 dB =  -6.00 dB
K-14 = 14.00 dB - 26.00 dB = -12.00 dB
K-12 = 12.00 dB - 26.00 dB = -14.00 dB
Norm =  0.00 dB - 26.00 dB = -26.00 dB


Rise time of peak meters (0 dBFS sine)
======================================
immediate (one sample)

K-20 = 20.00 dB
K-14 = 14.00 dB
K-12 = 12.00 dB
Norm =  0.00 dB
